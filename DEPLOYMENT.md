# üöÄ Deployment Guide

## Overview

This TV Show Search App is a **static site** that can be deployed to any static hosting service. It uses CDN dependencies and doesn't require a Node.js server.

## üìã **Deployment Requirements**

### Static Files Required

- `index.html` - Main application entry point
- `styles.css` - Application styles with responsive design
- `app.js` - Main application logic
- `analytics.js` - Analytics tracking (optional)
- `config.js` - Configuration management
- `responsive-enhancements.js` - Mobile optimizations (optional)

### CDN Dependencies (loaded in HTML)

- **Axios**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios@1.6.0/dist/axios.min.js`

### Environment Variables (Optional)

- `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` - Google Analytics 4 measurement ID

## üîß **GitHub Pages Deployment**

### Automatic Deployment

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/static-deploy.yml`) that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.

### Manual Setup

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
3. Set source to "GitHub Actions"
4. The workflow will automatically deploy your site

### Adding Analytics (Optional)

1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Add a new secret named `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`
3. Set the value to your Google Analytics 4 measurement ID (e.g., `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
4. The next deployment will include analytics tracking

## üåê **Other Hosting Platforms**

### Netlify

1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Set build command: `echo "Static site - no build required"`
3. Set publish directory: `/` (root)
4. Add environment variable `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` if using analytics

### Vercel

1. Import your GitHub repository
2. Framework preset: "Other"
3. Build command: Leave empty or use `echo "Static site"`
4. Output directory: `./`
5. Add environment variable `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` if needed

### Firebase Hosting

1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Initialize Firebase: `firebase init hosting`
3. Set public directory to current directory (`.`)
4. Configure as single-page app: Yes
5. Deploy: `firebase deploy`

### AWS S3 + CloudFront

1. Create S3 bucket with static website hosting
2. Upload all files to bucket root
3. Set up CloudFront distribution for HTTPS and CDN
4. Configure custom domain if needed

### Traditional Web Hosting

Simply upload all files to your web server's public directory (usually `public_html` or `www`).

   - [ ] Viewport scales properly on mobile
   - [ ] All breakpoints work as expected

3. **Interactive Features**

## üêõ **Common Deployment Issues**

### Issue 1: 404 Errors for Assets

**Cause**: Incorrect file paths
**Solution**: Ensure all paths in HTML are relative (e.g., `./styles.css` or `styles.css`)

### Issue 2: API Calls Fail

**Cause**: HTTPS/HTTP mixed content
**Solution**: Ensure your site is served over HTTPS and API endpoints use HTTPS

### Issue 3: Analytics Not Working

**Cause**: Missing or incorrect measurement ID
**Solution**: Verify `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` environment variable is set correctly

### Issue 4: Mobile Layout Issues

**Cause**: Missing viewport meta tag
**Solution**: Ensure `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` is in HTML head

### Issue 5: JavaScript Errors

**Cause**: CDN dependencies not loading
**Solution**: Check network tab in browser dev tools, verify CDN URLs are accessible

## üìä **Performance Optimization**

### For Production Deployment

1. **Enable Compression**: Configure your hosting to serve files with gzip compression
2. **Set Cache Headers**: Configure appropriate cache headers for static assets
3. **Use CDN**: Consider using a CDN for your static files
4. **Optimize Images**: Ensure any images are optimized for web

### Monitoring

- Use Google PageSpeed Insights to check performance
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Check mobile usability in Google Search Console
- Use browser dev tools to identify performance bottlenecks

## üîê **Security Considerations**

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Consider adding CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks:

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://www.googletagmanager.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self' https://api.tvmaze.com https://www.google-analytics.com;"
/>
```

### HTTPS

Always serve your site over HTTPS, especially when using analytics or making API calls.

## üìù **Deployment Logs**

The GitHub Actions workflow provides detailed logs for each deployment. Check the Actions tab in your repository to see:

- Build status
- File validation results
- Environment variable injection
- Deployment success/failure

## üîÑ **Rollback Strategy**

### GitHub Pages

- Revert the commit that caused issues
- Push the revert to trigger a new deployment

### Other Platforms

- Most platforms keep previous deployments
- Use their dashboard to rollback to a previous version
- Or redeploy from a previous git commit

## üìû **Support**

If you encounter deployment issues:

1. Check the deployment logs first
2. Verify all files are present and correctly referenced
3. Test locally to ensure the issue isn't in the code
4. Check the hosting platform's documentation
5. Review this guide for common solutions

**Note**: This is a static site with no server-side dependencies. It should deploy easily to any static hosting platform that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
